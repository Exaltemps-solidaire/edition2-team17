#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bootstrap.sh — provisions an app's core dependencies, idempotent.
#
# What the script does (read-only unless something is missing):
#   1. Creates the Postgres DB <APP> + the user <APP> with a random password
#   2. Stores the connection string under secret/<APP>/postgres
#   3. Creates the S3 bucket <APP> if it does not exist
#   4. Optionally, applies anonymous public read access on the bucket
#   5. Generates an S3 key pair SCOPED TO THE APP'S BUCKET if the store has none
#   6. Stores the S3 keys under secret/<APP>/objectstore
#   7. Optionally (LLM_VKEY=1), publishes the app's LLM virtual key in
#      secret/core/llm-vkeys (self-service §11.6) + a copy in secret/<APP>/llm
#   8. Optionally (TEMPORAL_NS=1), creates the app's Temporal namespace (§10)
#      + a copy of the coordinates in secret/<APP>/temporal
#   9. Optionally (ANALYTICS_SITE=1), creates the app's analytics website (§18.3)
#      + its runtime config in secret/<APP>/analytics
#
# Re-runs are harmless: every step checks the state before acting.
#
# Usage:
#   APP=myapp ./bootstrap.sh
#   APP=myapp PUBLIC_BUCKET=1 ./bootstrap.sh        # media served to the browser
#   APP=myapp LLM_VKEY=1 ./bootstrap.sh             # an agentic app (§11)
#   APP=myapp TEMPORAL_NS=1 ./bootstrap.sh          # durable workflows (§10)
#   APP=myapp ANALYTICS_SITE=1 ./bootstrap.sh       # navigation tracking (§18.3)
#
# ═══ NO HOST CLI IS REQUIRED ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
# The platform's services ship their own CLI. This script resolves each one as
#   a host binary that ANSWERS  →  otherwise `podman exec <container>`
# so a bare machine can bootstrap an app. `bao`, `mc` and `temporal` on the host
# are comfort, never prerequisites. Only `podman` and `openssl` are required.
#
# ⚠ A binary being on the PATH is NOT proof that it works: a workstation set up
#   before the OpenBao swap may carry a `vault` that is itself a
#   `podman exec vault.internal …` shim pointing at a container that no longer
#   exists under that name. So each candidate is PROBED, not merely detected.
#
# Overrides (rare — the defaults point at the core in dev):
#   BAO_ADDR=http://localhost:8200        BAO_TOKEN=root-dev-token
#   BAO_CONTAINER=openbao.internal
#   S3_URL=http://localhost:9000          S3_CONTAINER=s3
#   POSTGRES_CONTAINER=postgres.internal
#   POSTGRES_ROOT_USER=postgres           POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD=postgres-dev-password

# --- The secret store -------------------------------------------------------
# The resolver below is the CANONICAL one, copied verbatim from
# core-platform/lib/secrets.sh between the snip markers — an app repo is
# standalone, so this is the one copy a symlink cannot remove.
# doctrine/check.py fails the build if the two blocks ever diverge;
# to update: edit lib/secrets.sh, then copy its marked block over this one.
# --8<-- [start:bao]
# _bao_resolve — picks the first candidate that ACTUALLY ANSWERS, memoised in
# _BAO_MODE (the probe costs one call; the scripts then call bao in a loop).
#
# ⚠ TWO TRAPS, both met for real on a workshop machine:
#
#   1. `command -v bao` matches the SHELL FUNCTION `bao` defined below and
#      resolves to itself → infinite recursion. Hence `type -P`, which only ever
#      looks at executables in PATH and returns their absolute path.
#
#   2. A binary being ON THE PATH does not mean it WORKS. Workstations set up
#      before the OpenBao swap carry a `~/.local/bin/vault` that is itself a
#      `podman exec vault.internal vault …` shim — `vault.internal` is now only a
#      NETWORK ALIAS, not a container name, so that shim fails on every call.
#      Trusting PATH would pick it and every script would die.
#
# So we PROBE rather than detect: each candidate gets one `status`, the first
# that answers wins. Self-healing, and it costs one call.
